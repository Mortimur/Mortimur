- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mortimur
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything and everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or trying to learn about the real America that Americans today must have forgotten or are actually completely ignorant of.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on history, geography, Language Arts, mathematics, etc.. I'm really not sure if Ive waisted too much time already and deciding what is priority is difficult for me because I am mentally afflicted with indecisiveness. I thirst for knowledge and understanding more that anything else in life and can't stand the thought of leaving this life having only obtained the wisdom I have. I long to learn self-discipline and restraint, to gain better control of my anger, and to learn patience.
- 📫 How I can be reached: Email: mortimurzshadow@gmail.com and also by phone at (720) 481-5615.
